Interpreting Africa\'s Past: the Use of Ekistics and Oral Tradition in the Examination of Great Zimbabwe** \n\n* **URL:** https://openworks.wooster.edu/independentstudy/8/ \n* **Abstract:** This study uses archaeological research to examine the society responsible for building Great Zimbabwe and related sites in Southeast Africa. It critiques previous research tainted with ethnocentricism and aims to re-examine materials to understand the context surrounding the construction of the complex. The project explores how the architecture reflects the society that built it. Importantly, it incorporates interviews and oral traditions to supplement archaeological and historical materials. This approach seeks to provide a useful approach for Africans as they attempt to reclaim their past, and will be informative in the study of complex societies in African archaeology.\n\n**2. Sino-African Relations: Various Media Perspectives and The Impact of Chinese FDI on African Inequality**\n\n* **URL:** https://openworks.wooster.edu/independentstudy/4/\n* **Abstract:** This paper focuses on the impact of Chinese investment in Africa, particularly its resource-focused investments and the impact on African wage inequality. The project uses a theoretical model based on Heckshcher-Ohlin Stopler Samuelson and the "Dutch Disease" models to demonstrate how changes in the relative supply and price of African resource goods can affect African wage inequality. The paper also analyzes conflicting perspectives on Sino-African relations from Chinese, Western, and African media sources. It reveals three distinct ideological stances on the issue. OLS regression models were conducted, but the results should be interpreted with caution due to data availability and estimation issues. The paper ultimately argues that African countries must be cautious of China\'s FDI and its goal of extracting African natural resources, suggesting African governments should implement policies to protect themselves from resource exploitation. \n',

            abstract: 'In the context of a popular topic, China\'s investment in Africa, this paper delves into China\'s resource focused investment and the impact that this investment has on African wage inequality. The theoretical model expands on the classic 2x2 Heckshcher-Ohlin Stopler Samuelson model, and a more recent theoretical ideology known as the "Dutch Disease" model, to show how changes in the relative supply and relative price of African resource goods can affect African wage inequality. A discourse analysis comparing and contrasting the conflicting perspectives of the Chinese media, Western media, and African media revealed three different ideological stances on the issue of Sino-African relations. OLS regression models were conducted, and although results showed that Chinese FDI and corruption had a correlation with greater African inequality. However, due to data availability and estimation issues, the results should be taken with caution and under suspicion. Review of media sources, journal articles, books, and documentaries revealed that African countries must be cautious of China\'s FDI, and China\'s goal of extracting African natural resources. Thus, African governments and its leaders must devise proper policies towards Chinese FDI, in order to protect themselves from resource exploitation.',

            abstract: "This study uses a multidisciplinary method of archaeological research to examine the structure of the society responsible for construction of Great Zimbabwe and related sites in Southeast Africa. Great Zimbabwe epitomizes exploitation of the environment in a way that sparks complex societies. Previous research on Great Zimbabwe was tainted with ethnocentricism. Therefore, the goal of this study is to re-examine the materials in an attempt to understand the context surrounding the building of this enormous stone complex. Specifically, I explore how the architecture reflects the society that built it. Since the study of Africa's past by the West has been problematic in the past, I also include data from interviews and oral traditions to build upon the archaeological and historical materials. This approach may provide a useful approach for Africans as they attempt to reclaim their past, and will be very informative in the study of complex societies in African archaeology.",

Since then, this passion has only continued growing, becoming a more and more important part of my life.

It was my intention to create a document that is fully accessible in both English and Chinese. Or at least accessible in Chinese to the fullest of my linguistic capacity. I chose to use a collection of mediums because I believe it is the best way to present the most detailed portrait of the Beijing underground scene.',

            abstract: "Chinese foreign policy is an extremely dynamic factor in today's world. One way of trying to describe Chinese foreign policy is by determining national role conceptions of Chinese leaders. The national role conception that Chinese leaders have plays an essential part in the development and implementation of Chinese foreign policy. The different conceptions of China's role in the international system, as determined by Chinese leaders, gives an important contribution to understanding the rise of China as a leading world power. It is obvious that different leaders have had different views regarding what China's position should be in the global community. Some leaders have wanted China to become a world leader while others have wanted China to play a different part in international affairs by being a spectator. These different foreign policy behaviors can potentially be a result of the way in which Chinese leaders view themselves in the international system. Therefore, I hypothesize that Chinese national role conception, as determined by Chinese political leaders, leads to the foreign policy behavior of China. With this hypothesis, I wish to document the changes in Chinese leaders' national role conceptions and see if those differing views have led to different foreign policy behavior. This will occur through an analysis of speeches, documents, and writings of different Chinese leaders including Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. The sources will be analyzed to develop national role conceptions and see if the differing conceptions resulted in different foreign policy behavior.",

            abstract: "The present study examines the development of the medieval walled city of Cork, co. Cork, Ireland, through public, economic, and domestic architecture. Three key periods are under investigation: the ninth through late twelfth century when the Vikings settled the area, the late twelfth through the fourteenth century when sources reference the building of the walls, and the fifteenth century, the period before the dismantling of the walls. The main questions to be answered are: what priorities influence the location of settlements, what factors determine the location of centers within the settlement (with emphasis on location inside and outside the town walls), and what these conclusions reveal about the society. The approach is based on several theories (spatial analysis patterns, central place theory, Losch's theory, central institution theories, star theory, and sector theory) that seek to explain settlement distribution, location of central places, the rise of urban centers, and their expansion. Comparison of Cork to other Scandinavian, English, and Irish towns, places it in its cultural context. The results indicate that Cork is generally similar to other towns of the time period, with some significant differences. Its initial development follows both the models of uniform and cluster patterns. The results also indicate that there is an interest to place centers to serve the most individuals. Expansion of the settlement led to the eventual unification of the clusters.",

            abstract: "This thesis explores the changing Chinese American identity through the changes to Chinese food. Understanding one's identity is a difficult task because of its abstract nature; using a concrete element such as food, makes this task far easier. This method of using food to describe the Chinese American identity is especially helpful because of the importance placed on food in Chinese culture. For the Chinese, food is central to their identity because it is believed that the correct intake of food achieves a balance in one's life. It is also helpful, because the Chinese restaurant in America is a common sight and many Americans' only exposure to Chinese culture. Through a study of the changing Chinese American identity from the Exclusion Era in America to the present and through a study of the changes of Chinese cuisine in America over the same period of time, we can see how these changes mirror one another and allow for an understanding of what is the Chinese American identity.",

In Shanghai, an area economically and politically significant for the Guomindang (KMT), the Right encountered a situation where it was the most beneficial for them to deliberately employ the help of the Green Gang, the city's premier secret society and criminal organization. In order to achieve their ends, Chiang Kai-shek and the conservative faction of the KMT sidelined party ideology, long-held biases, and alliances to better pursue a realistic and pragmatic strategy for national unification. This project will examine the motivations behind the Guomindang's deliberate choice to work with Shanghai's underworld (among other groups in Shanghai) and the methods and strategy used to recruit similar potential regional allies.",
